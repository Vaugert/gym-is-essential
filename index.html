            <hr id="head-linebreak">
            <p>
                When you exercise your brain releases a chemical substance called Endorphins.
                <hr id="p-linebreak">
                Endorphins interact with receptors inside your brain that reduces your perception of pain.
                <hr  id="p-linebreak">
                They also trigger a postivie feeling in your whole body, similar to morphine, but natural produced.

            <hr id="head-linebreak">
            <p>
                For the majority of us who regularly works out, it's about packing on a lot of muscle and improve strengt and endurance over time.
                <hr  id="p-linebreak">
                <hr  id="p-linebreak">
                Correct me if i'm wrong, but you'd rather love your body than hate it right? If you don't feel comfortable wearing your favourite outfit, you will carry that same energy around with you.
                With exercising you can slim and shape your entire body, getting rid of any bulges or handles. The best way to put a smile on your face.
                
                <hr  id="p-linebreak">
                <hr  id="p-linebreak">
                People who exercise a lot like to progress. When you train with us, you will experience something called progressive overload.
                This is when you gradually increase the weight, frequency, or number of repetitions over an extended peroid of time.
                The strategy is perfect to never reach a plateau, but also always keep the competition with yourself and not others.
