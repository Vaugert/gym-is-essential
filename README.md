#Gym Is Essential
Gym Is Essential-Eliteclub is a page created to help two personal trainers get their real life and online customers to sign up and begin a proccess with one of the coaches online.
John is an ex Cross-fit Professional who is coaching in cross-fit and HIIT training.
Mike is a bodybuilder and nutritionist who is coaching and helping people with diet plans and training programs.



## Features
Navigation bar
- It is responsive and includes jump-links to all parts of the page, Home, About us and sign up. It allows easy navigation (ex, if someone only visits the page as a landing page to sign up, they can easily do so).

## Landing page
It is a photo with text that shows you where the page is based.
It is a cool looking picture that wants you to read further.

## Elite Club 
This sections is showing benefits that comes with training. It is not the usual benefits ex, (you get stronger and more muscular),
it is benefits that helps your all day life rather than only in the gym. 
This encourages the user to think outside the box a little and have even more reasons than the obvious to start training with a coach.

## Pricing 
Here you have 4 different very affordable plans to choose from, the strength training plans also comes with meal plans, as Mike is also a nutritionist.
Which ever the costumer chooses, they will be approached by one of the coaches to talk more in detail.

## Sign up form
The sign-up form is a motivational message followed by a leading question, so the costumer wants to fill the form out.
It also has a motivational picture to get them even more excited.

(In the future) 
I would like the lets train button to have an action that sends the customer a welcome message and also a booking system that provides them with times that they can talk to the coaches to get started. 








## Release History

We continually tweak and adjust this template to help give you the best experience. Here is the version history:

**September 1 2021:** Remove `PGHOSTADDR` environment variable.

**July 19 2021:** Remove `font_fix` script now that the terminal font issue is fixed.

**July 2 2021:** Remove extensions that are not available in Open VSX.

**June 30 2021:** Combined the P4 and P5 templates into one file, added the uptime script. See the FAQ at the end of this file.

**June 10 2021:** Added: `font_fix` script and alias to fix the Terminal font issue

**May 10 2021:** Added `heroku_config` script to allow Heroku API key to be stored as an environment variable.

**April 7 2021:** Upgraded the template for VS Code instead of Theia.

**October 21 2020:** Versions of the HTMLHint, Prettier, Bootstrap4 CDN and Auto Close extensions updated. The Python extension needs to stay the same version for now.

**October 08 2020:** Additional large Gitpod files (`core.mongo*` and `core.python*`) are now hidden in the Explorer, and have been added to the `.gitignore` by default.

**September 22 2020:** Gitpod occasionally creates large `core.Microsoft` files. These are now hidden in the Explorer. A `.gitignore` file has been created to make sure these files will not be committed, along with other common files.

**April 16 2020:** The template now automatically installs MySQL instead of relying on the Gitpod MySQL image. The message about a Python linter not being installed has been dealt with, and the set-up files are now hidden in the Gitpod file explorer.

**April 13 2020:** Added the _Prettier_ code beautifier extension instead of the code formatter built-in to Gitpod.

**February 2020:** The initialisation files now _do not_ auto-delete. They will remain in your project. You can safely ignore them. They just make sure that your workspace is configured correctly each time you open it. It will also prevent the Gitpod configuration popup from appearing.

**December 2019:** Added Eventyret's Bootstrap 4 extension. Type `!bscdn` in a HTML file to add the Bootstrap boilerplate. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/Eventyret/vscode-bcdn" target="_blank">README.md file at the official repo</a> for more options.

## FAQ about the uptime script

**Why have you added this script?**

It will help us to calculate how many running workspaces there are at any one time, which greatly helps us with cost and capacity planning. It will help us decide on the future direction of our cloud-based IDE strategy.

**How will this affect me?**

For everyday usage of Gitpod, it doesn’t have any effect at all. The script only captures the following data:

- An ID that is randomly generated each time the workspace is started.
- The current date and time
- The workspace status of “started” or “running”, which is sent every 5 minutes.

It is not possible for us or anyone else to trace the random ID back to an individual, and no personal data is being captured. It will not slow down the workspace or affect your work.

**So….?**

We want to tell you this so that we are being completely transparent about the data we collect and what we do with it.

**Can I opt out?**

Yes, you can. Since no personally identifiable information is being captured, we'd appreciate it if you let the script run; however if you are unhappy with the idea, simply run the following commands from the terminal window after creating the workspace, and this will remove the uptime script:

```
pkill uptime.sh
rm .vscode/uptime.sh
```

**Anything more?**

Yes! We'd strongly encourage you to look at the source code of the `uptime.sh` file so that you know what it's doing. As future software developers, it will be great practice to see how these shell scripts work.

Happy coding!
