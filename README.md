## Features

### Navigation bar
- It is responsive and includes jump-links to all parts of the page, Home, About us and sign up. It allows easy navigation (ex, if someone only visits the page as a landing page to sign up, they can easily do so).

### Elite Club 
- This sections is showing benefits that comes with training. It is not the usual benefits ex, (you get stronger and more muscular),
- it is benefits that helps your all day life rather than only in the gym. 
- This encourages the user to think outside the box a little and have even more reasons than the obvious to start training with a coach.

### Pricing 
- Here you have 4 different very affordable plans to choose from, the strength training plans also comes with meal plans, as Mike is also a nutritionist.
- Which ever the costumer chooses, they will be approached by one of the coaches to talk more in detail.

### Sign up form
- The sign-up form is a motivational message followed by a leading question, so the costumer wants to fill the form out.
- It also has a motivational picture to get them even more excited.

(In the future) 
- I would like the "lets train" button to have an action that sends the customer a welcome message and also a booking system that provides them with times that they can talk to the coaches to get started.
